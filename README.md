## 🧠 How It Works

1. Waste is scanned or placed in a smart bin
2. Sensors determine whether the type of waste matches the bin category
3. If correct: user gains reward points
4. If incorrect: waste is auto-transferred or flagged, and user receives a penalty
5. Points can be used to unlock discounts or civic benefits
6. Admins can track disposal patterns and optimize pickup routes
